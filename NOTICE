This framework was developed while dreaming of referring to element 127 as "IAnium" (currently known as unbiseptium).
The name "IAnium" is derived from the VOCALOID character IA, birthdate January 27, combined with the suffix "-nium" commonly used for elements.

IA and related names are trademarks or registered trademarks of their respective owners.
